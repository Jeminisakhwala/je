			<td class="A" >
JG College of Commerce, managed by ASIA Charitable Trust (ACT) and affiliated to Gujarat University, was established in the year 1999 under the auspices of our visionary late Shri John Geevargese. The college has carved a name for itself for its academic initiatives and extracurricular activities. Bolstered by the concerted efforts of its dynamic and highly qualified faculty members and the entire college staff, J G College of Commerce has become a force to reckon with in the realm of education. Ever since its inception, the college has time and again proved its mettle in academic excellence and has successfully hosted the Gujarat University Youth Festival for 12 times – a record in itself and one that is unsurpassed by any other college affiliated to Gujarat University.

The college has distinctly achieved an all pervasive success and the results are palpable on all fronts. JG College strongly believes in the holistic development of the students. Apart from academics, JGCC has a dynamic sports wing, NSS, NCC and a Women’s Development Cell. There remains no doubt that all the initiatives and activities of the college give out a prognosis of a very bright future for the institute. We at JG College of Commerce, will diligently and steadfastly continue our march towards greater success and excellence as the college is firmly committed to its high standards of academic excellence and welfare of its students and employees.
